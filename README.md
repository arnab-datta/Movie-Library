# MOVIE-LIBRARY
 > A web app that enables to know movie details and also insert the same into the database.

## ABSTRACT

 >This report details the work done towards the project Movie Library. This particular project has been developed to know movie details by just a single click through Internet.<br>
We have used local host database and server for this purpose. Our data is getting stored in the local host database and the website is running on local host server. Besides movie details, we have also added song details respectively for each movie in our database. So, one can easily get to know everything about a movie all at a time instead of surfing for all separately.

## INTRODUCTION

>Before talking about the code, there are a couple of things that we want to point out. One, we pardon our mistakes in this project work. Two, we are dealing with software development for personal purposes in an amateur fashion. They are probably not the best-practices.   But our purpose is to reflect our ideas, find solution to our problems.<br>
Now, let's talk about the project in brief. This is mainly a Movie Wikipedia where you can get to see the details related to the movies which are stored in the database. It is web based application software which has the provision to collect all the details of the movie so that they can be stored in the database.

## SPECIFICATION OF MOVIE LIBRARY

>Before starting to design a software product, it is extremely important to understand the precise requirements of the user and to document them properly. The goal of the requirement analysis and specification phase is to clearly understand the customer’s requirements and to systematically organize these requirements in a specification document. Movie Library requires simple hardware and software to be implemented. This is a no cost system which has no hard and fast rules for implementation and execution. This is a highly flexible web application from the view point of its execution. The technologies used for the development are all free since open source software is used. So no copyright issues are involved for installing and executing this.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES :
To develop an efficient Movie Library System with front end web interface and back end database.

## TECHNOLGIES USED :
* XAMPP Server
* HTML5
* PHP
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* AJAX
* JQUERY

##### XAMPP Server
>XAMPP is a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and deployment purposes.

##### HTML
>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing internet audience under the direction of the W3C, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.

##### CSS
>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation and content, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file.

##### JavaScript
>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. JS enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it.

##### AJAX
>Ajax short for “Asynchronous JavaScript And XML” is a set of Web development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous Web applications can send and retrieve data from a server without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Ajax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information.

##### JQUERY
>JQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. jQuery’s syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. JQuery Mobile is a UI framework geared to mobile applications that is built on jQuery.
